We derive a confidentiality measure against an adversary deploying a known-plaintext attack on the search agents Encrypted searches.
We perform a time series analysis on a theoretical adversary in order to derive an estimator of the forecast distribution
on the confidentiality measure, which may be used to inform policies such as when and how frequently a password change may
be called for to maintain a minimum level of confidentiality.
